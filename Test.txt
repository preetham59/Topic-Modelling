US Election: Biden steady in national polls; Trump's 'summer swoon over', say pundits

With little over a month to go for the US presidential election, the pundits seem to be in agreement: While nationwide polls indicate a comfortable lead for Joe Biden over Donald Trump  the battleground states are pointing to the Democratic challenger handing the US president a defeat.

This is no surprise. Over the past few months, Biden has been hovering around the 50 percent mark and the president has been perennially trapped in the low-to-mid 40s (not being able to clear the 50 percent mark has, historically, been considered a danger sign for an incumbent).

As per the CNN poll of polls, Biden currently leads Trump 51 percent to 44 percent.

Teflon Don versus Steady Joe

This year has been quite the decade. A pandemic, protests, floods and fires.

But throughout the year, with all its ups and downs, Trump and Biden's positions in national polling have remained unchanged.

In 2016, we saw the advent of Teflon Don. In 2020, we're seeing the wonders of sleepy steady Joe.

A new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll finds Biden holding an eight point lead over Trump among registered voters (51 to 43 percent) as more than a plurality give the president a thumbs-down on his job performance.

“So far, despite major upheavals in the country, little has changed,” Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt, who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff, told NBC News.

“In 2020, the fundamentals of our country have been shaken to our core, while the fundamentals of the election have not,” Horwitt added.

Trump continues to hold an edge when it comes to the economy, while Biden is overwhelmingly favoured when it comes to dealing with COVID.

“Trump’s summer swoon is over,” added McInturff, the GOP pollster.
Clinton, though she maintained a lead over Trump for the entirety of the 2016 campaign, and received nearly three million more votes in the general election, found her presidential bid undone thanks to the electoral college.

Remember, the United States picks its president via the electoral college system, where each state is allotted a number of electors. While there are 538 electoral votes up for grabs, the magic number is 270.

Trump, who ran up victories in the so-called Rust Belt states such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, ultimately received 304 votes and Clinton, with 227, fell way short of the mark.

The difference between Trump and Clinton ultimately came down to just 78,000 votes in the three aforementioned Rust Belt States.

But 2020 is not 2016. And with Trump as the incumbent and America gripped by the coronavirus (200,000 dead and counting) and witnessing inflamed racial tensions in the aftermath of the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, things are playing out a little differently on the ground, particularly where it matters the most.
